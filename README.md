# paint-like

Welcome to this little front-end app fully developed in jQuery with a basic touch of CSS. This is a paint like, feel free to visit the gh-page to test the app and draw whatever you want, I am sure you will inderstand how it works pretty well.

Why have developped this app ? As a trainer in web development for the Simplon Roubaix school I have to provide students mutliple exercices to improve their skills. This is one the final exercices of the front-end development path that takes around two months in our 6 months trainning.

At this moment students feel comfortable with standard JavaScript and discover librairies, such as jQuery, to see how easily the DOM can be.
